[["index.html", "Pan Mass Challenge 2025 1 Nine years and rolling", " Pan Mass Challenge 2025 David McCormick 2026-01-04 1 Nine years and rolling This year marked my 9th Pan Mass Challenge (PMC) ride to support the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Despite a demanding work schedule, I was blessed to be joined by my daughter, Ellen, and two of my best friends: college friend, Ed Kenealy, and my PhD advisor and long-time friend, John Grotzinger. For Ed, it was his 12th Pan Mass and the first time for John. I continue to be part of the fabulous Team Crank, that provides an incredible match to our fundraising from the Warren Alpert Foundation, this year to the tune of $750,000. The team is raised the full amount for the match and we donated over $1.5 million to Dana-Farber. All of your contributions were doubled, which meant I was able to contribute nearly $40,000. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who supported me. What follows is my attempt to evoke the sights, sounds, and feelings of something so worthwhile and larger than myself. Join me. David https://profile.pmc.org/DM0478 "],["the-last-ride-out-of-sturbridge.html", "2 The Last Ride out of Sturbridge 2.1 First PMC Kismet", " 2 The Last Ride out of Sturbridge For several decades, the main two-day PMC ride has started from Sturbridge, MA, and follows a well-trodden path to Bourne, MA, at the edge of Cape Cod. For a variety of reasons, the leadership of the PMC wanted to shift to a new starting location. After several years of planning, they intend to start from Worcester, MA, about 25 miles northeast of Sturbridge. So this year was the final year for a start from Sturbridge. This year was my 5th time riding from Sturbridge, but Ellen had never ridden from there. I had hoped that she would be able to ride from Sturbridge to have the “traditional” full PMC experience, and fortunately, she was able to join. Also, my friend, John, could have the full experience. This year, we enlisted Ellen’s fiancé and John’s wife to ferry us from home to Sturbridge. As I have described in the past, it’s a bit of a mob scene in Sturbridge with all the riders being dropped off at the main hotel where everyone stores their bikes (aka, The Corral) overnight. Over the course of a few hours, thousands of people, their bikes, and luggage accumulate. Most years, 2500-3000 people leave from Sturbridge. As the afternoon went on, it seemed like significantly more people were arriving than I remember in previous years. I believe that many of us wanted to experience the traditional Sturbridge start for the final time. The check-in process is efficient, where you pick up your PMC jersey that everyone wears on Day 1 along with the tags that you put on your bike that indicate your name, your town, and how many years you have ridden the PMC. Every PMC rider gets a nametag that shows where they live and how long they have been riding the PMC. One fun tradition is that if someone is a first-time rider, the staff will ring a loud cowbell to alert the assembled masses that someone is new to PMC. My friend, John, was treated to this bell-ringing welcome. After we get our packets, we affix the tags to our bikes, and put a tag to your shirt for when you are wandering around before and after the ride. Like with other mass-start events (think Boston or New York Marathons), these include an RFID chip that allows the PMC to track when everyone crosses timing strips when they leave Sturbridge and enter and leave every rest stop along the route, then arrive in the final stops, like Bourne on Day 1 or Provincetown on Day 2. My 2025 PMC jersey, tag, and the lei I picked up on Day 1. Once we had put the tags on the bikes and unpacked in our hotel rooms, we go to the food area at the main hotel. Throughout the PMC weekend, there is abundant food and drink and you never pay for anything (having paid for it upfront with your registration fee). At Sturbridge there is a large tent with tables to eat and meet with friends and team members. As I have described before, over the years you start to recognize some of the riders who participate year on year. It’s easier on the road when people wear team jerseys (on Day 2) or familiar attachments to their helmets (like the green frog for Team Kermit, or the plastic martini glasses for the Spin &amp; Tonics). 2.1 First PMC Kismet I have spoken before of what I call PMC Kismet. This takes 2 forms: 1. The Known Unknown: You know someone is signed up for the PMC and you hope to cross paths and eventually do. 2. The Unknown Unknown: Serendipitously, you cross paths with someone you know that you had no idea was riding PMC. Ellen and I had the Unknown Unknown version: 5 minutes into the food area, I saw someone’s name badge who had an uncommon last name that sounded like a relation of my wife, Ebit. I asked and it was Phil Trottman from Greenwich, CT, who was riding his first PMC. The first PMC Kismet of 2025: meeting Ebit’s cousin, Phil Trottman the night before the PMC ride. We made the connection and I realized only now that Phil is what PMC calls “Living Proof”, someone who is riding the PMC who has been diagnosed with a form of cancer and is either undergoing active treatment or has been successfully treated. I have friends who are Living Proof riders. They are tangible evidence of the importance of the importance of and the need for the types of unflagging clinical research that the PMC funds. People like Phil make it real for me in the moment. We communed with our friends and teammates, let go of the quotidian anxieties and concerns of the previous week, and settled into the unique environment of PMC. On the Friday night before PMC at the Sturbridge site, there is highly organized and -produced psych-up event is held. Billy Starr–the founder of PMC 46 years ago–and his staff bring a combination of Dana-Farber leadership, cancer researchers, and testimonials of people who have been treated by Dana-Farber. It is always moving and drives home the essential mission of what we do by riding and fundraising. This year the hall was filled to overflowing, further underscoring how many people had come to start for the last time from Sturbridge. Billy Starr emphasized how essential our efforts and your generosity are this year. So this gave extra urgency to our efforts to raise money for this most worthy of causes. "],["day-1-sturbridge-to-bourne-109-miles.html", "3 Day 1: Sturbridge to Bourne (109 miles) 3.1 At the rest stops 3.2 Friends enroute 3.3 Day 1 results 3.4 After Day 1: the kindness of family and friends", " 3 Day 1: Sturbridge to Bourne (109 miles) We rise at 4:30 AM to be able to dress, schlep our gear to the trucks that will take them to our first day finish at Bourne, MA, then get breakfast at 5 AM. As in previous years, PMC recruits cheerleaders from the local high school to cheer us as we enter the breakfast area, which always makes me smile. Between the bus drivers ferrying riders from surrounding hotels, the people laying out breakfast and coffee, and the cheerleaders, I’m always so appreciative of the 6,000 volunteers that make our catatonic stumbling and ride so easy and seamless. We just wake up, eat, ride, eat, drink, ride, eat, drink, shower, and eat. They make it so much easier and so much more pleasant. The Day 1 start at Sturbridge was the same as previous years: Team Crank crowded ourselves into the starting area, Billy Starr said his brief words of charge, then a volunteer sang the national anthem, and we were off, shuffling in our cycling shoes and cleats through the portal, across the timing strip, then mounting and beginning the journey. At the corral for PMC start in Sturbridge. As you pass through the portal, the narrow street is lined with people–families of all ages–who come and are already cheering for you, thanking you for riding. As always, this is recurrs all day, all weekend. The PMC gets the entire eastbound lane of Route 20 (parallel to the Massachusetts Turnpike) to the PMC riders for the first 5 miles. About 1/2 mile from the start, two ladder fire trucks suspend an enormous American flag that we roll under. I always find it incredibly moving. What a way to depart from Sturbridge. The hallmark of this year’s PMC was the spectacular weather. We had two days of sun, low humidity and high temperatures in the high 70’s to low 80’s, and with a quartering tailwind in much of the ride. It was hands-down the best weather I’ve ever had on a PMC weekend. And all the PMC riders I spoke with that weekend–many of whom have been doing this for 15-25 years–said the same thing. This was in marked contrast to our experience 2 years ago, the last time Ellen rode it with me, when people–including one of my friends–were taken to the hospital due to heat exhaustion and dehydration. Not so this year: we rolled out of Sturbridge with the temperatures in the mid-50’s and sufficiently chilly that I was glad that I brought some thin arm warmers; a light cycling vest would have been even better. The cool temperatures created fog on the ponds we paseed I found myself taking in more of the ponds and woodlands and scenery than I remember. Partly it was the beauty of the rising sun and the misty ponds and field, and partly it was desire to imprint these scenes to memory, as we won’t pass this way again. Day 1 from Sturbridge is long at 109 miles and has some short but taxing climbs. There are bystanders that try to make the effort more enjoyable. My favorite one is people at the top of one of the steeper pitches that hand out leis. I always try to get one and wear it through the day. I find the whimsy of it amusing, a marker of the crazy-quilt PMC experience. There is an organic, flowing nature to a large-scale cycling event. At the start, we are a mass of riders, otherwise known as the “peloton”. The combination of the variety of people’s cycling abilities, the variety of terrain, and the quality of the road surface serve to eventually stretch out the original large group. There is an ebb and flow to the peloton. Sometimes the climbs cause coagulating of many riders, then the flats and downhills allow me to separate from others. Given sufficient distance, you come to a steady state, passing few, few passing you. Several times when I was riding with Ellen we were alone, riding at our own pace, not having to pay attention to other bikers. Those were lovely moments. One thing that makes riding the PMC enjoyable is the that in many places along our route the PMC has hired local police to allow us to just roll through most intersections. You don’t notice it at first, but added up over two days, not having to stop and start again, just rolling though, saves considerable energy and reduces the need for vigilance about cars. My favorite part of Day 1 is when we turn onto Cherry Street in Wrentham, MA. Every year this 1/2 mile tree-line stretch is full of people who set out banners and there is a steel drum band and a separate group of bag pipers. The whole community seems to turn out. I always laugh and delight in the support we get from such communities. Farther down the road the routes from Sturbridge to Bourne merge with the route from Wellesley to Bourne. It feels like the confluence of a tributary river that fills the streets. 3.1 At the rest stops Just after the joining of the routes we get to the main lunch stop at Dighton-Rehoboth High School. We arreived by about 10:30 AM. By then we have been riding for 70 miles and nearly 4.5 hurs, so eating lunch is totally appropriate. The whole clock for the weekend is moved forward by about 2-3 hours. At lunch we are often able to reconnect with our team members and chill for 30-45 minutes. Generally, if you are doing a long endurance ride, when you stop for food and drinks, it’s best to be as quick as possible, 5-10 minutes being ideal, lest your muscles start to tighten up and make restarting harder. With a group of people, that’s always more challenging, but with a committed group of 4-6 people, it’s manageable. Day 1 lunch in Rehoboth with John, Ellen, and Ed. I’m wearing the lei I picked up enroute. 3.2 Friends enroute Just after the last rest stop in Wareham, MA, our great friends Jane and Garry Douglas were by the side of the road with a banner for us. It’s particularly nice to have friends show up and encourage us. Jane and Garry Douglas cheer us on on Day 1 near Wareham. 3.3 Day 1 results Day 1 done: 109 miles, 6h 43 mins riding time, 9h 3 mins total time elapsed. 3.4 After Day 1: the kindness of family and friends I took my friend John around the PMC encampment at Massachusetts Maritime Academy where the PMC ends after Day 1. We grabbed a coffee and some food, listened to a little music, and took in a little of the post-ride ambiance. Our great friends Jane and Garry Douglas left a car so that John and I could drive ourselves and our bikes back to their lovely house in Wrentham, MA, about 6 miles away. This was a wonderful gathering, complete with luxurious showers, adult recovery beverages and a delicious barbecue dinner. We were joined by my partner, Karen, John’s wife, Donna, Ellen’s fiancé, Michael, another PMC rider and fiend, Peter Worley, and our friends Susan and Roger Mann. Susan has been undergoing active chemotherapy for cancer for the last 18 months or so. Dinner for the PMC riders and our partners. Best of all to have Susan and Roger Mann join us. It was deeply meaningful to be able to spend time with all these dear friends and have Susan as a tangible reminder of why we ride. Our great friends, Liney and Paul Bolick, provided overflow housing nearby in Marion for the extra-large contingent this year, for which we are truly grateful. With very comfortable beds, we were soon asleep, sleeping the sleep of the righteous–or at least physically tired. "],["day-2-bourne-to-provincetown-76-miles.html", "4 Day 2: Bourne to Provincetown (76 miles) 4.1 The Cape Cod Canal 4.2 Down the spine of Western Cape Cod 4.3 Eastern Cape Cod 4.4 Day 2 results 4.5 Provincetown 4.6 Final PMC Kismet 4.7 The Fast Ferry Home", " 4 Day 2: Bourne to Provincetown (76 miles) Day 2 is a very early start. We aimed to be back in Bourne and ready to roll by 4:45-5:00 AM. That means a 3:30 AM start to get groggily up, dress, get breakfast, and drive back to the start about 20 minutes away. But we manage with the help of our dedicated support crew. Our crew under the flattering sodium vapor lights before dawn in Day 2 just before we left Bourne. From left to right, John Grotzinger, Ed Kenealy, Ellen McCormick, and yours truly. The early start before dawn on the road necessitates the use of head- and tail lights. The PMC has arranged that we can cross over the Bourne Bridge onto Cape Cod with one of the lanes dedicated just to bike riders. This is a huge gift, because during normal hours, you would have to walk your bike over the bridge on a raised sidewalk, for the better part of half a mile, which would be no fun at all. In addition, by going very early, we miss the majority of the people trying to cross after 5 AM. 4.1 The Cape Cod Canal We loop around under the bridge and go on the Cape Cod Canal bike path. This is an amazing treat for several reasons. First, it’s dead flat for 5 miles, which is the perfect way to get your legs to wake up after the demands of the previous day. Second, it’s a bike path, so you don’t have to worry about cars, which removes some of the need for full attention (which is harder at 5 AM before dawn). Third, it’s a beautiful experience riding path and seeing serpentine trail of blinking red tail lights trailing out as far as you can see. Finally, we are riding into the sunrise by the time we reach the end of the line in Sandwich, MA, at the east end of the canal and bike path. And like the giant flags from the fire trucks in Sturbridge the day before, there is a fire boat that sits in the canal spouting water as a recognition of the PMC riders coming through. A flattering view of me on the Cape Cod Canal bike trail just before dawn on Day 2. 4.2 Down the spine of Western Cape Cod We enter regular roads for a few miles out of Sandwich as we gently climb up parallel to the main highway that runs down the spine of Cape Cod (Route 6). We end up on the access road that parallels Route 6, which for you geology and geomorphology fans, is a terminal glacial moraine, the end point of the glaciers. Once we get up on the service road, the fun begins with a long stretch of rolling short descents and climbs. The climb to the access road serves to filter out a lot of riders. By the time you are up on the access road, there are relatively few riders with you, so you can let it rip. You can easily get up a good head of steam and get to 30-35 mph on the descents, which will get you up most of the next climb with minimal effort. When you get the rhythm going, it’s great fun and the miles fly by. We hit the first rest stop in Brewster at 22 miles by about 6:25 AM. We regrouped with most of the Team Crank crew. We tried to ride as a group from there out, with varying degrees of success. One of the nice moments of Day 2 is stopping by the roadside near Dennis, MA, where one of our Team captains has a house. His family meet him at the intersection of our route and provide donuts (which none of need after the recent rest stop) and well wishes. Like last year, a guy who was treated at Dana-Farber and has been 10 years in remission was there with a sign to thank all the riders. Again, he is a tangible reminder of why we ride. Team Crank on Day 2 in Dennis with the man successfully treated at Dana-Farber. The stretch from Brewster to Orleans requires more concentration: we are on the main streets that pass through the towns on the bay side of Cape Cod, and by 7-8 AM there are some cars on the road. The locals know that the PMC will be coming through and generally steer clear of the PMC route, but there are some poor souls that have to drive on those roads. It can be nervous-making for both the drivers and the riders, as thousands of riders, sometimes in long lines one and two abreast slowly make their way up the roads, making it difficult for cars to pass or make turns. This is my least favorite part of the PMC weekend, but everyone seems to make it through safely. If you are overtaking other riders, you generally say “on your left” and try to pass as quickly as possible, and slot back in to the right. But sometimes you just have to decelerate, sit back for a minute or two, chill out, and just take it all in; it’s not a race…for most people. My friend, John, for example, was absolutely crushing it all day, playing with the two strongest riders in Team Crank, Patrick and Bill. They made it to Provincetown at least 40 minutes faster than we did, and they had an absolute blast doing it. We rode past the former site of Cape Cod Sea Camps where for so many years hundreds of campers and adults lined a long hedge (aka, “Da Hedge”), giving us encouraging shouts. Sadly, the camps were sold a few years ago. My friend, John, who rode with us this year went to the Sea Camps was a camper and counselor for many years when he was a kid. It was nostalgic for him. There are still people who come out at Da Hedge to wave us on, so the tradition is not entirely lost. Eventually we get to the second rest stop at Nickerson State Park in Orleans near the elbow in Cape Cod. It’s smaller in area, so it always feels like a mob scene. But you manage to see a lot of the bigger teams that come year after year. I managed to connect with my National Grid colleague, Fred, who is an absolute animal of a rider. My colleague, Fred, and me at Nickerson State Park in Orleans, MA. The full regalia of his team, Phat Tuesday, was on display. We try to make that stop as short as possible, because it’s a bit of a crush getting out. As the weather was fabulous and everyone was feeling good, we pressed on. We were half way done and not event 9 AM. 4.3 Eastern Cape Cod When you go through Orleans and Eastham, the crowds and cars thin out, and I feel more relaxed. I tried to be a better father this year and stay with Ellen as much as I could. Depending on how many people were around and whether I was ahead, I wasn’t always conscious of whether she was on my wheel. In these sections on the northern Cape, Ellen and I were able to ride together alone at several points, which is very relaxing, not having to watching for riders braking, or being able to see potential hazards much sooner. It feels more like being out on a small group ride when you are training for the PMC. At Eastham we use the Cape Cod Rail Trail for about 4 miles. This is always such a relaxing part of the ride, where we don’t have to worry about cars, and just have to be mindful of the runners and walkers who use the trail. It’s always under the trees, so we are sheltered from wind and sun, though that was not a factor this year. We exit the rail trail in Wellfleet and turn right toward the Marconi Wireless Radio Station historic site and the climb up onto Ocean View Drive that looks out over the Atlantic Ocean. It’s one of my favorite places to ride and a highlight of the weekend. We ride past the locally famous Beachcomber Bar and Restaurant (aka, “The Coma”). We then dive into the woods with some short, sharp, steep descents, curves, and climbs as we wind our way back towards the final rest stop at a school in Wellfleet. The mood at this stop is generally jubilant. Teams are regrouping. It’s 10 AM and we are only 20 miles from the finish. It all seems to go so quickly on Day 2. No need for ice couches or large amounts of rehydration as in previous years. Everyone was feeling great. The majority of Team Crank was able to reassemble in Wellfleet, and we set off on the final stretch. We do 2 miles on Rt. 6, then peel off into the quieter wooded side roads in Wellfleet, with their kettlehole ponds and oak trees, which is exceedingly pleasant. We wind our way back from the Atlantic side to the Cape Cod Bay side of Wellfleet and get to ride through some remarkably hilly short sections and the beautiful tidal marshes. There is no avoiding some riding on the main road, Route 6 in this final stretch. The shoulders are very wide and the conditions are generally good with minimal debris on the road, but it’s much less enjoyable with cars going by at 50+ miles per hour, even if they are shouting an honking encouragement. We have to use an 8 mile stretch of Route 6. In some years it can be a brutal combination of strong northerly headwind and hot, exposed roads with no shade. This year there was some headwind, but no heat. The key to getting through that section is trying to get a good paceline established: ride single file with riders of about your ability and have people take turns riding on the front for a few minutes. If you do it right, just maintain a steady pace, you can overcome the effects of the headwind, save enormous amounts of energy, and make the miles roll by quickly. We did a good job on that section in about 25 minutes. We turned off Route 6 to head on the final 4.5 loop out Race Point Road through oak forest and out onto the dunes north of Provincetown. It’s a lovely stretch, essentially free of cars, and everyone knows it’s the home stretch. A complex set of emotions set in, knowing we are about to finish. The entire Team Crank regrouped before the finish so that we could all cross the finish line together. One of our team members who is currently undergoing cancer treatment managed to make the entire ride and she was the first one to cross the finish line for our team. Cathy and Bridget were the first to cross the line for Team Crank in Provincetown. 4.4 Day 2 results Day 2 ride from Bourne to Provincetown. 76 miles, 4 hours 25 minutes riding time, 6 hours 3 minutes total time. 4.5 Provincetown As is the custom, just after finishing, we took our team photo under the PMC banner. It’s a moment of collective joy. The weather was so spectacularly good, that everyone was feeling well, no one overheated, all with fatigue, but mostly a sense of satisfaction. The training, the fundraising, the effort all behind us. Team Crank at the at the PMC finish at the Provincetown Inn. All smiles. The shower in the military shower tent always feels magnificent. Out of our rigid cycling shoes, strip off the sweaty clothing, let the warm water wash away the salt and grime. Utter bliss. And then it’s on to the food tent for unlimited servings of things like lobster bisque or New England clam chowder from Legal Seafood, wraps, hamburgers, salad…whatever you need, plus adult recovery beverages. And then you find your tribe and start to relive the weekend. 4.6 Final PMC Kismet The final installment of PMC Kismet happened when I ran into a dear friend, Alex Whiting, who I had no idea was riding. We compared our experiences and how great the weather was for all of us. Our friend Alex, Ellen, and me in the food tent at the Provincetown Inn. The final PMC Kismet of 2025. 4.7 The Fast Ferry Home To get back to Boston, some people stay overnight in the area, or have loved-ones drive them back to the mainland. The majority take one of several ferries back to Boston. I mostly have opted for one of the fast ferries that take about 90 minutes. Leaving at 2pm, it means I can generally be home by 5pm. After the two days of rising before 4:30 AM, I know I will turn into a pumpkin by about 8pm. Ellen, John, and I and several Team Crank members took the 2pm fast ferry back. The seats are comfortable and some immediately go do sleep for the duration of the trip. John and I reflected and reminisced about the the small moments, the feeling of being swept along in the river of riders, and the magnitude of the event. John Grotzinger and me on the fast ferry back from Provincetown to Boston with our adult recovery beverages. There wasn’t much wind, so the trip was very comfortable. It’s a lovely way to come into Boston via the South Shore beach communities, through the Harbor Islands, past Logan Airport. There is always a fireboat in Boston that is spraying its water jets for the returning PMC ferries. We came into the World Trade Center docks and slowly disembarked the boat with our luggage and retrieved our bikes. Unlike last year, there was no rain to drench us at the docks. Ellen’s fiance, Michael, was kind enough to meet Ellen and me, while John’s wife, Donna, took John off back to New Hampshire. Back in Boston with John, Ellen, and Ellen’s fiance, Michael. A wonderful end to the weekend. And so it was over. Two days gone in a seeming flash. But great satisfaction and enjoyment and connection. "],["why-i-ride.html", "5 Why I Ride 5.1 For whom we ride", " 5 Why I Ride There is a feeling that I get when I’m near the end of a long, demanding ride. It is often a combination of relief and elation: relief for being able to complete something that is demanding, possibly something that tested my current level of ability; elation for knowing it was demanding and I was able to complete it. Finishing the PMC adds another layer: I am often washed over by a wave of acute sadness and grief, the reminder of why we ride: for those we have lost, for those facing the trials and tribulations of active cancer treatment, for those supporting them, and for the wide web of all those affected by cancer. In those moments, I am immensely grateful for what we can do individually and collectively how this adds up to so much: $20,000 from you becomes $40,000 from the 1:1 matching that Team Crank gets from the Warren Alpert Foundation $750,000 that Team Crank raised became $1.5 million for the PMC through the 1:1 match, and all the PMC riders donated $78 million in total from this single weekend. Year after year, this is a remarkable outcome. Now more than ever, these contributions are essential to the Dana-Farber’s mission to advance their world-class cancer treatment and research. You all make an impact for Dana-Farber. As the PMC motto says, we are closer by the mile. With immense gratitude, David McCormick Acton, Massachusetts https://profile.pmc.org/DM0478 5.1 For whom we ride You have shared with me the names of loved ones that have been afflicted by cancer, some gone, some undergoing active treatment, some in remission, and some undetectable.
