# Why I Ride

There is a feeling that I get when I'm near the end of a long, demanding ride. It is often a combination of relief and elation: *relief* for being able to complete something that is demanding, possibly something that tested my current level of ability; *elation* for knowing it was demanding and I was able to complete it. Finishing the PMC adds another layer: I am often washed over by a wave of acute sadness and grief, the reminder of why we ride: for those we have lost, for those facing the trials and tribulations of active cancer treatment, for those supporting them, and for the wide web of all those affected by cancer.

In those moments, I am immensely grateful for what we can do individually and collectively how this adds up to so much:

-   \$20,000 from you becomes \$40,000 from the 1:1 matching that Team Crank gets from the Warren Alpert Foundation
-   \$750,000 that Team Crank raised became \$1.5 million for the PMC through the 1:1 match, and
-   all the PMC riders donated \$78 million in total from this single weekend.

Year after year, this is a remarkable outcome.

Now more than ever, these contributions are essential to the Dana-Farber's mission to advance their world-class cancer treatment and research.

You all [make an impact for Dana-Farber.](https://www.pmc.org/impact)

As the PMC motto says, **we are closer by the mile**.

With immense gratitude,

## For whom we ride

You have shared with me the names of loved ones that have been afflicted by cancer, some gone, some undergoing active treatment, some in remission, and some undetectable. I carry this ever growing list of names with me on my rides as my motivation and as a reminder of why we do this.
